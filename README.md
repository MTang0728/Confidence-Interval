# Medium Post Demos

This repository contains simple demo codes that are used in my [Medium blog](michaeltang101.medium.com) posts. I have found Medium an amazing platform for learning from other aspiring data practitioners and keeping myself abreast of the latest tech in the industry. Therefore, I started my own Medium and I hope to share my experiences with this diverse community.

My posts mostly revolve around concepts that I found confusing or interesting. I hope to review these concepts to consolidate my understanding. At the same time I hope others will find them informative. I also plan to write about my projects and competition experiences.
